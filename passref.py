"""Pass-by-reference expansion for rescued blobs.

A rescued result can be handed to another tool without the model ever reading
it: the model writes the token ``tla:<blob_id>`` as a downstream tool's
argument, and this tool_request middleware swaps the token for the blob's full
content before that tool runs. The large payload flows tool to tool and never
re-enters the context window.

The whole point is to move content the model has not seen, so expansion is
bounded by size (to protect the receiving tool, not the context) and degrades
to an honest marker when a blob is missing or over the cap.

Phase 0 hardening (T0.3): a separate ``passref_external_destinations`` config
key denies expansion into mail-send / social-post / webhook / peer-messaging
classes by name. This deny list is NEVER merged into ``exclude_tools`` (those
tools' oversized results must still be rescued — passref just refuses the
cross-tool handoff) and overrides ``passref_allowed_tools`` when both name a
tool: an operator's permissive allowlist cannot re-enable an external send.

Phase 1 instrumentation (T1.5): every terminal expansion outcome is
appended to a JSONL audit ledger at ``store_path/ledger/expansions.jsonl``.
A failure to write the audit line is logged at WARNING but NEVER raises
into the expansion path — observability must not break delivery.
